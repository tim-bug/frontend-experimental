In Next.js, as with any web application, the decision of what should be handled server-side and what should be handled client-side depends on various factors such as performance, security, user experience, and functionality. Here are some general guidelines:

Server-side:

Initial page rendering: In Next.js, the server can generate the initial HTML and serve it to the client, which is faster than waiting for the client-side JavaScript to render the page.

Server-side data fetching: If data needs to be fetched from a third-party API or a database, it can be done server-side to reduce the load on the client.

Server-side authentication and authorization: Authentication and authorization checks should be performed server-side to prevent unauthorized access to the application or sensitive data.

Server-side rendering of dynamic content: If a page has dynamic content, such as personalized content or content that changes frequently, it can be generated server-side to improve performance and SEO.

Client-side:

User interactions: Client-side interactions such as form submissions, button clicks, and user inputs should be handled on the client to provide a seamless and responsive user experience.

Client-side data fetching: If data needs to be fetched from an API after the initial page load, it can be done client-side to reduce the load on the server.

Client-side validation: Form validation and other input validations can be performed client-side to provide instant feedback to users and reduce the load on the server.

Dynamic client-side rendering: If the content needs to be updated frequently without a full page reload, it can be done client-side using JavaScript frameworks such as React.

Overall, the decision of what should be handled server-side and what should be handled client-side should be based on a careful consideration of the trade-offs between performance, security, user experience, and functionality.
